## Preliminary Dataset Chosen:
Left/Right Hand 1D/2D movement 1-Dimensional - https://sites.google.com/site/projectbci/
## Progress - November 14, 2021
- Training method has been attempted on different (but similar dataset) by Nutapol
- ## NEXT STEPS:
Complete training and achieve good accuracy.
## Progress - November 7, 2021
- Dataset has been converted into frequency-domain with all channels seperated
- Power line at 50 Hz has been removed
- Bandpass filter (Unsure which frequency range to use yet)
## Progress - October 31, 2021
- Dataset has been chosen
- Group members have read at least 2 papers (Prasant Kumar Pattnaik, Jay Sarraf, Brain Computer Interface issues on hand movement + 2 more papers each)
- Chosen dataset has been explored by all members and coverted from .mat to .csv format by Nutapol
## NEXT STEPS:
Perform preprocessing - mainly with respect to artefact removal and fourier transform into time domain. (Eye was closed)
## Literature Review:
Research done on same dataset - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319157816300714
