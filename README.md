## Preliminary Dataset Chosen:
Left/Right Hand 1D/2D movement 1-Dimensional - https://sites.google.com/site/projectbci/
## NEXT STEPS:
Analyze raw dataset and perform preprocessing - mainly with respect to artefact removal and fourier transform into time domain. (Eye was closed and power band line seems to have already been removed.)
## Literature Review:
Research done on same dataset - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319157816300714
